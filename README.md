# **CryptoTrader using Reinforcement learning**

## Motivation
Based on this [article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/a-complex-reinforcement-learning-crypto-trading-environment-in-python-134f3faf0d7a), I decided to give it a try and produce my own and try to extract some insights from the cryptocurrency market.

## Initial thoughts and assumptions



## Structure
- **viz_initial_data**: Data prelim analysis and visualization
Loading crypto historic data (downloaded from [Kaggle and coinmarketcap](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory)) in a Jupyter notebook, and creating some graphs using Plotly.

- **my_env**


- **my_testing**
